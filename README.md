# Coaty Examples

This project includes a set of fully documented code examples that demonstrate
best practices and typical usage patterns for Coaty applications. The examples
are substructured by available Coaty language variants, such as `js` for Coaty
JavaScript and `swift` for CoatySwift. Some examples, such as Hello World and
Remote Operations provide interoperable Coaty agents programmed in different
language variants.

* [**Hello
  World**](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples/tree/master/hello-world/js)
  This example demonstrates the basic use of communication event patterns to
  exchange typed data in a distributed Coaty application.

* [**Remote
  Operations**](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples/tree/master/remote-operations/js)
  This example demonstrates how to use the Call-Return communication event
  pattern to perform context-filtered remote operations between Coaty agents.

* [**Sensor
  Things**](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples/tree/master/sensor-things/js)
  This example demonstrates how Coaty leverages the SensorThings API to manage a
  self-discovering network of sensors.
