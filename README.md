# Coaty Examples

This project includes a set of fully documented code examples that demonstrate
best practices and typical usage patterns for Coaty applications. The examples
are substructured by available Coaty language variants, such as `js` for Coaty
JavaScript. Some examples, such as Hello World, provide interoperable Coaty
agents programmed in different language variants.

* [**Hello
  World**](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples/tree/master/hello-world/js)
  This example demonstrates the basic use of communication event patterns to
  exchange typed data in a distributed Coaty application.

* [**Remote
  Operations**](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples/tree/master/remote-operations/js)
  This example demonstrates how to use the Call-Return communication event
  pattern to perform context-filtered remote operations between Coaty agents.

* [**Sensor
  Things**](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples/tree/master/sensor-things/js)
  This example demonstrates how Coaty leverages the SensorThings API to manage a
  self-discovering network of sensors.

## Contributing

github](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples). Contributions are welcome
and appreciated.

The recommended practice described in the contribution guidelines of the Coaty
framework variants also applies here.

For example, for Coaty JS, use Conventional Commits Style for your commits and
prepare and publish a new release by using the provided npm run scripts
`cut-release` and `push-release` (as explained
[here](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
